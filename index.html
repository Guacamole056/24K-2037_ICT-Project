            Currently, I'm a student passionate about Cyber Security. I enjoy
            learning about new technologies and their applications in real-world
            scenarios. I’m driven by the challenge of solving complex problems
            and securing digital systems. I thrive in environments that allow me
            to innovate and push boundaries. Outside of work, I’m an avid gamer
            and enjoy watching shows, which helps me unwind and stay creative.
            I’m always eager to learn, grow, and find new ways to apply my
            skills, while maintaining a balance between my career and personal
            interests.

        <p>
          In ten years, I see myself thriving in the field of cybersecurity and
          computer science, ideally in a leadership role where I can drive
          innovation and protect digital systems. I aim to blend my passion for
          technology with strategic problem-solving, contributing to the growth
          of the industry. At the same time, I hope to maintain a balance that
          allows me to enjoy my hobbies, like playing video games and watching
          shows. My goal is to build a career that’s both impactful and
          fulfilling, while also making time for the things I love.

        <p>
          Several individuals inspire me for their unique qualities and
          achievements. <b class="emphasis-text">Muhammad Ali</b>, the boxing
          legend, has always been a profound source of inspiration due to his
          unwavering confidence, determination, and ability to overcome
          adversity. His mantra of "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"
          represents both mental and physical strength, reminding me to stay
          resilient in the face of challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b class="emphasis-text">Chris Broad</b> from
          <i class="emphasis-text">Abroad in Japan</i> inspires me with his
          unique blend of humor, storytelling, and authenticity. His ability to
          present his experiences and insights with such clarity and creativity
          motivates me to communicate effectively and to always strive for
          excellence in my own work, no matter the medium.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a more personal level, my <b class="emphasis-text">parents</b> are
          my role models. Their resilience, hard work, and unwavering support
          have taught me the importance of perseverance, balance, and
          maintaining a strong ethical foundation in both personal and
          professional life. They’ve shown me that success is not just about
          achieving goals but also about staying true to one’s values.
